WebGL setup for rendering multi-pass shader networks for image processes.

This demo shows my basic setup for developing WebGL pages with image processing effects. It doesn't use any WebGL frameworks,
as my intention was to create a minimal setup that is simple for me to develop for. This works for me, but it's probably too bare-metal 
for most usages. It's a good starting point though if you want to understand framebuffers and fragment shaders in WebGL, so there's probably
some educational value here.
